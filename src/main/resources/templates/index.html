        <p class="text-justify lead" style="margin-top: 50px;">Fred McFeely Rogers, aka Mr. Rogers, the undisputable
            unofficial official saint of children's programming, would say that in times of crisis, always look for the
            helpers. With all that's going on in the world today, you may feel compelled to come to the aid of others, no
            matter if it's around the corner or around the world.</p>
        <p class="text-justify lead">Whether it's committing random acts of kindness or raising funds for noble causes,
            donating your time, energy or money, you want to do your part to help heal our planet. That's where we
            come in.</p>
